 <!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="about-card">
  <p>
    I’m Rutej Talati, a mechanical engineer passionate about uniting mechanical precision with intelligent control and design. My work focuses on automotive systems, mechatronics, and data-driven engineering, building machines that think, adapt, and perform.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an undergraduate at Penn State University, I’ve worked across autonomous vehicle research, CFD-based aerodynamics, and NVH optimization. Whether it’s refining a drivetrain’s smoothness or simulating airflow over a Formula 1 car, I enjoy turning theory into measurable performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond engineering, I’m fascinated by how innovation, leadership, and design thinking shape the next generation of mobility. When not building or analyzing, I’m probably breaking down F1 strategies, experimenting with robotics, or sketching new concepts for smart mobility systems.
