  This capstone project focused on structural durability evaluation and load path optimization of automotive and off highway
  drive axle systems under realistic operating conditions. The primary objective was to improve durability and NVH assessment
  fidelity by integrating multi body dynamics simulations with finite element based structural analysis.
</p>

<p>
  Detailed axle geometry was developed in SolidWorks based on sponsor discussions and publicly available design references due
  to confidentiality limited hollow models provided by Dana Incorporated. Structural stress and strain analysis was performed
  to identify critical load bearing regions under combined torque bending and operational loads representative of backhoe
  loader duty cycles.
</p>

<p>
  Multi body dynamics simulations were conducted using MSC ADAMS to generate time varying drivetrain load profiles. These
  simulations were developed collaboratively with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and later extended independently to ensure
  full understanding of the motion model and data exchange between ADAMS and SolidWorks based workflows.
</p>

<p>
  Dynamic load histories generated from ADAMS were correlated with structural results to establish a load to life durability
  workflow. Design level geometry refinements reduced peak stress concentrations by approximately six percent while preserving
  packaging and functional constraints improving overall durability confidence.
</p>

      <small>August 2023 – December 2023</small>
    </div>

    <p>
      First year engineering design project at Penn State University sponsored by Wabtec Corporation, a US based construction
      and mining equipment manufacturer. The project addressed fuel inefficiency in large mining dump trucks caused by long
      haul distances and high fossil fuel consumption during site access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Evaluated alternative energy concepts including solar and full electrification and identified limitations due to
      external energy dependence. Proposed a piezoelectric energy harvesting approach leveraging the high ground pressure and
      mass of mining trucks to generate electrical energy through mechanical deformation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developed a concept involving piezoelectric plates embedded along haul paths and within tire structures to enable
      continuous energy generation during vehicle operation. The system was designed to supplement onboard battery storage
      and regenerative braking to reduce overall fuel dependency while improving operational efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modeled tire deformation behavior in SolidWorks and analyzed strain to electrical output relationships using MATLAB to
      estimate power generation potential. Results indicated a partially self sustaining system capable of significantly
      reducing fuel consumption under realistic operating conditions.

    <h5>Research on Aerodynamics and Wake Management in Formula 1</h5>
    <div class="meta">
      <small>January 2023 – August 2023</small>
    </div>

    <p>
      Independent research project driven by interest in Formula 1 regulations and vehicle safety, focused on understanding
      wake turbulence generated by leading cars and its impact on following vehicle stability, cornering performance, and
      overtaking capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studied regulation driven aerodynamic constraints and analyzed laminar and turbulent flow behavior around open wheel
      race cars. Identified that high energy turbulent wakes generated by the leading car significantly degrade downstream
      flow quality, reducing downforce and inducing instability for the trailing car at high speeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developed simplified Formula 1 geometry using CATIA and SolidWorks and performed CFD simulations in ANSYS to analyze
      pressure distributions flow separation regions and wake structures. Iteratively refined front wing floor and rear wing
      geometries to preserve underbody downforce while reducing wake turbulence intensity downstream.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rear aerodynamic elements were redesigned to manage vortex shedding and promote cleaner wake structures, resulting in
      an estimated twenty to thirty percent reduction in wake turbulence intensity while maintaining comparable downforce
      levels. Structural checks were performed to ensure load bearing capability of aerodynamic components under realistic
      operating loads.
    </p>

    <p>
      The research was conducted in collaboration with a PhD candidate and culminated in
      a co authored technical paper submitted for peer review to a US based scientific journal, Advances in Aerodynamics. The project spanned
      eight months.

  This capstone project focused on structural durability evaluation and load path optimization of automotive and off highway
  drive axle systems under realistic operating conditions. The primary objective was to improve durability and NVH assessment
  fidelity by integrating multi body dynamics simulations with finite element based structural analysis.
</p>

<p>
  Detailed axle geometry was developed in SolidWorks based on sponsor discussions and publicly available design references due
  to confidentiality limited hollow models provided by Dana Incorporated. Structural stress and strain analysis was performed
  to identify critical load bearing regions under combined torque bending and operational loads representative of backhoe
  loader duty cycles.
</p>

<p>
  Multi body dynamics simulations were conducted using MSC ADAMS to generate time varying drivetrain load profiles. These
  simulations were developed collaboratively with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and later extended independently to ensure
  full understanding of the motion model and data exchange between ADAMS and SolidWorks based workflows.
</p>

<p>
  Dynamic load histories generated from ADAMS were correlated with structural results to establish a load to life durability
  workflow. Design level geometry refinements reduced peak stress concentrations by approximately six percent while preserving
  packaging and functional constraints improving overall durability confidence.

    <p>
      Independent research project driven by interest in Formula 1 regulations and vehicle safety, focused on understanding
      wake turbulence generated by leading cars and its impact on following vehicle stability, cornering performance, and
      overtaking capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studied regulation driven aerodynamic constraints and analyzed laminar and turbulent flow behavior around open wheel
      race cars. Identified that high energy turbulent wakes generated by the leading car significantly degrade downstream
      flow quality, reducing downforce and inducing instability for the trailing car at high speeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developed simplified Formula 1 geometry using CATIA and SolidWorks and performed CFD simulations in ANSYS to analyze
      pressure distributions flow separation regions and wake structures. Iteratively refined front wing floor and rear wing
      geometries to preserve underbody downforce while reducing wake turbulence intensity downstream.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rear aerodynamic elements were redesigned to manage vortex shedding and promote cleaner wake structures, resulting in
      an estimated twenty to thirty percent reduction in wake turbulence intensity while maintaining comparable downforce
      levels. Structural checks were performed to ensure load bearing capability of aerodynamic components under realistic
      operating loads.
    </p>

    <p>
      The research was conducted in collaboration with a PhD candidate and culminated in
      a co authored technical paper submitted for peer review to a US based scientific journal, Advances in Aerodynamics. The project spanned

Data work has focused on cleaning datasets, defining metrics, analyzing trends and variance, and using charts to communicate insights. The goal is consistent: convert raw numbers into decision-ready interpretation and explain outcome drivers with quantitative clarity."

              data-text="Quantitative finance is interesting due to the modeling of uncertainty, risk, and system behavior using probability and math. Exploration has included building small models to reason about discounting, distributions, and risk-reward trade-offs, using a physics-style approach to validate assumptions. The same discipline used in engineering analysis—sanity checks, sensitivity thinking, and constraint awareness—carries over directly."
